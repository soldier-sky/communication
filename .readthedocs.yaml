# Project: SCORE Communication
# Recommended URL: https://score-communication.readthedocs.io/
# (Configure project slug in Read the Docs dashboard: Admin → Advanced Settings)
#
# This configuration installs Bazel and runs the full build pipeline on Read the Docs.
# Generated artifacts (Doxygen XML, API RST files, README) are created during the build.

# Required version 2 for all modern Read the Docs builds
version: 2

# Version control settings (optional - RTD will build all active versions by default)
# To control which branches/tags are built, configure in RTD dashboard: Admin → Versions
# URLs will be: /en/latest/, /en/stable/, /en/v1.0.0/, etc.
